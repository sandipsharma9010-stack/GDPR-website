          <h2>GDPR and Elearning Business</h2>
          <p>
            Due to GDPR compliance digital learning business domain require exhaustive changes in their process
            activities. Compliance is not restricted to their sales and marketing but their portals/products needs to be
            compliant as well.
          </p>

          <!-- <p>As per Article 46 of GDPR</p> -->

          <p>Major issue is with products where children data is captured (for creation of Ids). As children data is
            SPII it is important user is addressed at various levels about privacy compliance and data base needs to be
            restructured to ensure complete anonymisation and pseudonymisation of personal information.</p>

          <p>Bigger issues is with business discontinuity as companies in EU are looking forward to deal with companies
            who are GDPR compliant and their products/courses /content should speak loud about how compliance is
            managed.</p>

          <p>Looking at all these it is certain that cost of operation will increase though new opportunities will also
            enable companies to do more business or move into territories they may not have worked till now.</p>

          <p>You can see from this example that structural changes are required in business processing and IT controls
            are only small part of that.</p>
