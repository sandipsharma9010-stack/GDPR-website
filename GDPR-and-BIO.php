          <h2>GDPR and BIO/Pharma companies</h2>
          <!-- <h6>New requirements for Data processors under the GDPR</h6> -->
          <p>
            GDPR is far more rigorous and comprehensive, and adherence to other Privacy standards does not equate to
            compliance with GDPR.
          </p>

          <!-- <h5>HR and recruitment</h5> -->

          <p>Do you know It is not enough just to say, “we are compliant”? Companies must now be able to demonstrate
            compliance. If the ICO asks, you must be able to provide evidence such as procedures, training, data
            mapping, artifacts and consent forms, audit reports.</p>
          <!-- <h5>Fund Raising</h5> -->

          <p>Any initiatives/implementation you do which cannot generate the required evidence will make you
            Non-compliant. It’s also worthy to note that merely by documentation that majority of consultants are doing
            will not make you compliant. GDPR requirement will require the amalgamation of processing activity and
            Privacy controls.
          </p>

          <!-- <h5>Website /portal/software</h5> -->

          <p>Every single hour in your Organization you deal with mammoth personal information that can lead to Data
            subject identification, including but not limited to name, date of birth, social security number, telephone
            number, full-face photos, biometric data, genetic data sensitive personal data such as racial or ethnic
            origin etc. Life sciences firms like you also deal with a huge amount of sensitive data on the top which
            makes your compliance more crucial and mandatory. Do you know companies that are not directly subject to the
            GDPR, but whose customers, research collaborators or contractors are subject to the GDPR, will also be
            affected? Do you know that Collaborators and (in some cases) contractors (such as CROs running clinical
            studies) are likely to seek contractual commitments to help them achieve compliance with the GDPR?. Do you
            that Its crucial to secure the data from the Origin to the destination? Do you know that You are liable for
            sanctions when your third-party vendor or sub-processor is responsible for the breach? Do you know that
            every single employee in your organization needs to be trained on GDPR as one of the compliance requirement?
          </p>


          <p>GDPR implementation needs to secure and safeguards you, your company vital interests and not to mention
            your reputation in the market. GDPR compliance is going to be a prerequisite in Life sciences industry
            before the execution of the project. In fact, None of the global controllers will ever want a noncompliant
            processor and a sub-processor. We know Compliance is always less expensive than Non compliance which is why
            we ensure to be your partners in this journey to assist the implementation letting you focus on your core
            business area.</p>
