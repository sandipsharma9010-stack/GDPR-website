          <h6>6. How do we secure the information collected?</h6>
          <p>
            At GDPR Consultants, we understand that the security of your personal information is essential. To ensure
            this, we have implemented robust administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to
            protect your data globally.
          </p>

          <p>Our privacy practices are structured to safeguard your personal information, with access to information
            stored on our servers hosted through Amazon Web Services (AWS) in India restricted to authorized employees
            who require it for their job responsibilities. Access is secured using user/password credentials and
            two-factor authentication.</p>
          <p>We employ industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect account registration and
            sign-up information. Additional security measures include multi-factor authentication, data encryption,
            firewalls, and strict physical access controls to buildings and files.</p>
          <p>We caution our visitors about phishing attacks, where malicious third parties attempt to obtain sensitive
            information by impersonating legitimate websites or sending deceptive emails. GDPR Consultants will never
            request sensitive data, such as financial or health information, via email or our websites. If you receive
            any such communication claiming to be from GDPR Consultants, please do not respond and immediately report it
            to dpo@gdprconsultants.in </p>
          <p>We also recognize the risk posed by spam emails and have implemented reasonable measures to minimize their
            transmission and impact within our computing environment.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are certified under ISO 27001:2022, reflecting our commitment to the highest international
            standards of information security. This globally recognized certification defines the requirements for an
            Information Security Management System (ISMS) and confirms that GDPR Consultants’ processes and controls
            provide a strong framework to safeguard both our clients’ information and our own organizational data.</p>

          <h6>7. How Is Your Personal Information Transferred Internationally</h6>

            or other countries, including on our service providers’ cloud servers (such as AWS). We implement

            and any legal exceptions, you are entitled to exercise the following rights with respect to your personal
            data:</p>

              <strong>Access Your Personal Data:</strong> You have the right to know if GDPR Consultants holds any
              personal data about you and, if so, to receive details about that data along with a copy.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Rectify Your Personal Data:</strong> You can request corrections to your personal data if it is
              inaccurate,
              incomplete, or outdated.</li>
            <li><strong>Object to Processing:</strong> You may ask GDPR Consultants to stop processing your personal
              data in certain
              situations, including when processing is based on legitimate interests.</li>
            <li><strong> Request Erasure: </strong>You have the right to request that your personal data be deleted,
              particularly when
              it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request that the processing of your personal data be
              limited under
              specific circumstances, such as when you contest the accuracy of the data or withdraw consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You are entitled to receive your personal data in a structured,
              commonly used, and

            <p>Processing of your personal data is based on your consent; you may withdraw that consent at any time by
              contacting dpo@gdprconsultants.in.</p>
            <p>Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal,
