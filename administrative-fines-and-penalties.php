            Non-compliance with an order by the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) shall, in
            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20,000,000 EUR, or in

            year, whichever is higher.

          <p>
            Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 58(2), each Member
            State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public
            authorities and bodies established in that Member State.
          </p>


          <p>
            The exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate
            procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and
            due process.
          </p>

          <p>Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be
            applied in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent supervisory authority and imposed by
            competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent
            effect to the administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall
            be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the
            provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any
            subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting them.</p>
